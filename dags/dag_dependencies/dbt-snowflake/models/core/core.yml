  - name: sessions
    description: P1 client session start events. These sessions are sent directly from the client. There are some key differences between how Adjust/Leanplum tracks a session vs how the client tracks a session. Adjust and Leanplum tracks sessions on 30-minute intervals, meaning that multiple app opens within the same 30-minute interval will be counted as 1 session. On the other hand, client count each app open as 1 single session. So core.session should almost always count more sessions than Leanplum/Adjust, but not always. For example a new device running the TextNow app will generate a LP/Adjust session, but it will never generate a core.session even as long as there is no registration/login. The other key difference is metadata enrichment. core.sessions is streamed from the clients, and we had some problems in the past that forced us to remove a lot of the session metadata to ensure we are at least logging session records correctly. So core.sessions does not offer much other than the count. Adjust and Leanplum provide a lot more data along with each session record
